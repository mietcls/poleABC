# Herstory

During the first COVID lockdown in Belgium of 2020, [Patricio](https://www.instagram.com/alfa.pole/) challenged a couple of fellow pole dancers to participate in the #alphabetpolechallenge. It was a lot of fun and kept us motivated to move our bodies during lockdown. Thanks for challenging us Patricio!

In October, we entered the second lockdown in Belgium. [Manoe](https://www.instagram.com/manoetamara/), one of the participants of the first lockdown challenge, decided it was time to take on this challenge once more because of its great success.

A lot of people got really enthusiastic this time. [Lise](https://www.instagram.com/lise.foket/) wanted to start an instagram group where we could share ideas and motivate each other (DM to join!). It got a bit of a hassle to keep up with the resources: and that's how [@pole.abc](https://www.instagram.com/pole.abc/) was born!
